# Project Proposal: Haskell Snake Game with Special Abilities and Puzzles

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a special Snake game using Haskell with added features and challenges. The Snake game is a popular and timeless arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat apples and grow longer. In our version of the game, we aim to introduce special abilities triggered by consuming specific apples, the inclusion of puzzles or mazes to increase complexity and engagement, and other enhancements to make the game more exciting and challenging.

## Project Objectives

1. **Haskell Snake Game Implementation:** Develop a Snake game using Haskell that includes the core gameplay mechanics, such as snake movement, apple generation, and collision detection.

2. **Special Abilities:** Introduce special apples with unique effects. When the snake consumes these special apples, it will gain abilities or trigger in-game events. These abilities could include temporary invincibility, speed boosts, new obstacles appearing, or enemies entering the game.

3. **Puzzles and Mazes:** Enhance the gameplay by incorporating puzzle elements or mazes within the game. These puzzles will add complexity and require strategic thinking from the player, making the game more challenging and engaging.

4. **User Interface:** Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the game, including features like a scoreboard, game over screen, and user-friendly controls.

5. **Testing and Debugging:** Thoroughly test the game to identify and fix any bugs or issues that may arise during development. Ensure the game is stable and free of major defects.

## Deliverables

1. **Snake Game:** A complete Snake game implemented in Haskell with the following features:
   - Snake movement and growth mechanics.
   - Apple generation and consumption.
   - Collision detection and game over conditions.

2. **Special Abilities:** Special apples that grant unique abilities or trigger in-game events.

3. **Puzzles and Mazes:** Integrating puzzles or mazes into the game to increase complexity.

4. **User Interface:** An intuitive user interface that includes a start screen, game over screen, and a scoreboard.

5. **Documentation:** Detailed documentation explaining how to play the game and how special abilities and puzzles work.

6. **Testing:** Test cases and a report detailing testing procedures and results.
